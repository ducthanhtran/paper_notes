* Term of 'Bubble Sort' appeared first in 1962, K. Iversion: *A Programming Language*, John Wiley.
    * Also known as 'sorting by exchange', 'jump-down sort', 'sorting by repeated comparison', 'sinking sort'
* Entered ACM algorithm repository as *algorithm 175* in 1963, named **Shuttle Sort**.
* Extension of bubble sort: additionally passing elements from top to bottom (known as **(Cocktail) Shaker Sort**)
* Gained popularity through textbooks like 1974, Aho et al.: *The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms*, Addison-Wesley.
* Author dismisses simple implementation and performance
    * Uses Halstead complexity to measure difficulty and effort
    * Quadratic runtime
    * For nearly-sorted data use insertion sort instead
