**Authors**:
* Lee, Jason
* Cho, Kyunghyung
* Hofmann, Thomas

## Key points
* build upon work of (Chung et al., 2016)[https://github.com/ducthanhtran/paper_notes/blob/master/machine_learning/nlp/machine_translation/16jmar_a_character_level_decoder_without_explicit_segmentation_for_nmt.md]
  * character-level decoder using a stacked RNN with GRU units
  * no explicit segmentation information required
* now: use encoder also on character-level, resulting in character-to-character machine translation
