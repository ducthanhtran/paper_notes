## Key points
* find cross-linguistic relationships through machine translation model
  * continuous latent space

### Experiments ###
* using bible texts of over 900 languages
  * language flags before source sentence marks target language
* using regular RNN-based NMT model with attention mechanism

#### Results ####
* massive dataset from different languages help avoid overfitting of model

## Comments
* left out technical details regarding experiments and model parameters
* how was training done? batch specifications missing
