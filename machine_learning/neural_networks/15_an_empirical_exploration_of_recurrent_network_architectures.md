## Key points
* forget gate in LSTM very important
* conducted RNN architecture search and evaluated on various tasks:
    * Arithmetic: compute sum/difference of two numbers
    * XML modeling: predict next character
    * Penn Tree-Bank word-level language modeling
* furthermore, evaluations were done on an additional music note prediction. This task was not used during search
* search was performed using a population-based evolutionary algorithm (meta-heuristic)
